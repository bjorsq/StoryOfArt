## User - 2026-10-02 16:22 UTC

There's another project I'd like to get some feedback on - this is in repos/StoryOfArt/tate version. It was a very long animated projection using SVG and SMIL - the SVG files were daisy-chained together (using javascript in Adobe's SVG viewer version 3 I think) otherwise the computer running them crashed because of a memory leak in the viewer I think? I'd love to re-package this as an SVG which will work in a modern web browser, or even capture it as video somehow?

## Claude

I'll start by looking at what's in the Tate version folder.

> *Bash: List the StoryOfArt Tate version files*

> *Bash: Read README and list supporting folders*

There are two sets: 101 files in `files/` and 8 larger ones in `tate version/`. I'll look inside the Tate files and the script.

> *Bash: Inspect Tate SVG structure and script*

> *Bash: Check font, box counts, durations and chaining*

> *Bash: Compute durations and animation variety per file*

> *Bash: Compare text order across files 7 and 8*

> *Bash: Total the 101-file version and list generator*

The README's 9h45m matches the 101-file set in `files/` (9.8 hours), not the 8-file Tate set. Before giving feedback, I'll check how a modern browser actually handles one of the Tate files.

> *Bash: Render soa1.svg in headless Chrome*

> *Read: scratchpad/soa1-4000.png*

> *Read: scratchpad/soa1-7000.png*

As expected, a modern browser won't parse it at all, because Adobe's viewer tolerated an undeclared `xlink` namespace. I'll patch a scratch copy to find the next problem down.

> *Bash: Test a namespace-patched copy in Chrome*

Confirmed: the layout script gets `NaN` everywhere. Next I'll stop the test servers.

> *Bash: Stop the temporary test servers*

I've looked through the archive and tried a Tate file in current Chrome. Short version: the original files can't simply be patched to run, but the piece itself is very well suited to the same approach as error404. The text and timing come out of the files as data, and one small player renders it, live in a browser or frame by frame to video.

## What happens in a modern browser

I tested a copy of `tate version/soa1.svg` in headless Chrome. It fails at three levels:

1. **Parsing.** The files use `xlink:href` without declaring the namespace, which Adobe's viewer tolerated. Chrome rejects the whole file with an XML error before anything runs.
2. **Layout script.** With the namespace fixed, `TextSpline` produces `NaN` for every position. It reads `font-size: 1.1` and the made-up `line-interval` property from the `style` attribute, and modern browsers drop invalid CSS declarations. So `getPropertyValue()` returns empty strings.
3. **Font.** The typeface "pm" is embedded as an SVG font (`<font>`/`<glyph>`) in every file. Only Safari still supports SVG fonts; Chrome and Firefox fall back to a default font. It can be converted to WOFF2 (e.g. with `svg2ttf`), but I can't tell from the glyphs what the typeface is. If it's a commercial font, its licence matters before you publish it on the web.

All three are fixable. Even then, one long SMIL document has the drawbacks below.

## Which version is the piece?

The archive has more than one version, and they don't agree:

| Set | Files | Text boxes | Running time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `files/` | 102 | 6,355 | 9.8 hours (matches the README's 9h45m) |
| `tate version/` soa1–7 | 7 | 2,362 | 12.3 hours |
| `tate version/` soa1–8 | 8 | 5,812 | 15.6 hours |

In the Tate set, `soa7.svg` ends with `loop(1)` rather than `loop(8)`. As archived, the piece never reaches `soa8` (POSTMODERNISM onwards, 3,450 boxes accelerating to 0.3s). Do you know whether that was deliberate, or whether it was edited at the Tate?

## What I'd do

**1. Extract the piece as data.** The animation is very regular. Each box has:
- the text and its wrapping settings;
- an approach phase that grows from 0 to 1em while rising 50px, with a spline easing;
- an exit phase from 1em to 20em, moving 950px down (or 1300px up for a few boxes);
- two durations, which shrink over the piece.

A script can pull all of that out of the SVGs into a JSON timeline, like the error404 extractor. The justification (`TextSpline`) can be worked out once with the converted font, rather than at load time. That load-time work is what took 3 minutes on the 2004 hardware.

**2. Render it with one small player that works out each frame from the time.** Each frame is a pure function of t: which box is showing, its scale and its y position, with the SMIL `keySplines` easing reproduced in a few lines of code. That gives you:
- **A live browser version.** Only one text element exists at any moment, so memory doesn't grow over 10 hours. The original problem that forced the daisy-chaining goes away. You also get seeking, e.g. `?t=4h30m` to check the fast end without watching nine hours.
- **Video from the same code.** Step the player frame by frame in headless Chrome and pipe the frames to ffmpeg. Because it's vector text rendered per frame, it can go out at 1080p, 4K or projector resolution.

**On video size and render time:** 9.8 hours at 30fps is about 1.06 million frames. Screenshotting in headless Chrome might take 10–15 CPU-hours, which splits easily into parallel chunks. White text on black compresses extremely well, so the H.264/H.265 file should be a few GB at most, even at 4K. One thing to check: at the fastest end, a box's whole exit lasts 0.3s, only about 9 frames at 30fps. The video may need 50 or 60fps to keep that legible.

**3. Keep a SMIL version only if fidelity to the original technology matters to you.** I could fix the namespaces, lay the text out in advance, swap in a WOFF2 font, and chain the files in a small HTML wrapper. It would be truer to the 2004 build, but each file is still a long chain of thousands of animation elements, with no seeking and the timing drift you get from long SMIL chains. I'd treat it as an archival curiosity, not the main version.

If that sounds right, I'd start with the extractor and a player for `soa1`, then render a 30-second test clip so you can compare the motion and easing against your memory of the projection. Two things I need from you first: which version is canonical, and whether you know what the "pm" font is.

---

## User - 2026-10-02 16:40 UTC

I corrected the loop in the tate version in situ when we installed, but I didn't realise there was less text in it. The whole piece was built from a text file supplied by the artist, which was parsed into a database, then the SVG created from the database using PHP. This way we could generate sections of the piece to preview. I'm pretty sure the tate version is canonical, but I'd be interested to find out how the text boxes differ, and why it takes so much longer. Not sure what the font was, but my business partner did do a previous piece with the artist and he may have made it (PM are his initials)

## Claude

I'll extract every text box, with its two durations, from both versions and compare them.

> *Bash: Extract and summarise boxes from both versions*

> *Bash: Diff box text between versions*

> *Bash: Inspect sample differences and word-level diff*

> *Bash: Compare section headings and order*

> *Bash: Compare speed curves and late sections*

> *Bash: Find speed calculation in the PHP generator*

Still digging into how the PHP generator calculated each box's speed.

> *Bash: Read generator script and functions*

> *Bash: Read animation tag generation and speed tables*

Each box's duration is stored per row in the database. Next I'll find the tool that set those values.

> *Bash: Find where per-box speeds were set*

> *Bash: Read the acceleration logic in controls.php*

> *Bash: Compare section timings between versions*

> *Bash: Trace where Tate's final section text comes from*

> *Bash: Check Toronto samples and text sources*

> *Bash: Match Toronto samples against both versions*

The Toronto samples match the Tate text exactly; `postmodernism.svg` matches 119 of 119 boxes, against 66 for `files/`. Last check: which of the text exports in `text/` matches which version.

> *Bash: Match text exports to each version*

First, a correction: the Tate version doesn't take longer. My earlier totals double-counted the exit phase, because the motion element also matched my pattern. The real running times are **Tate 9h30m** (5,812 boxes) against **9h49m for `files/`** (6,355 boxes). With your `loop(8)` fix, the Tate piece is about 19 minutes shorter.

## The Tate version is the final one

- `text/final_exported.txt` contains every Tate box (100%), but only 80% of the `files/` boxes.
- The Toronto samples match the Tate text box for box. `postmodernism.svg` matches 119 of 119 Tate boxes, against 66 of 119 in `files/`.

So the same text went to the Tate and to Toronto, and `files/` is a different edit. It's probably an earlier draft, though the archive doesn't prove which came first.

## How the text differs

**Up to about 1980** the two versions follow the same 69 sections in the same order. They differ in two ways:
- **Rewording.** The Tate text is often more compressed. For example, `files/` has three sentences about the Egyptians ("…system of government." / "Some of the greatest buildings…" / "The Pyramids, the Sphinx…"), which the Tate version joins into one. A Magritte passage goes from four boxes to one.
- **Sentences added or removed.** About 4,100 sentences are shared, about 830 appear only in the Tate version and about 1,320 only in `files/`.

**From about 1980 onwards** they're structured differently:
- **Tate:** after short SCULPTURE and PAINTING sections, a single 2,847-box run goes through artists alphabetically: Craigie Aitchison, Michael Andrews… This matches the artist's source files (`6_SOFA.1980+ chron 90s a-l` / `m-z`). It ends with "The kitchen is fully functional if minimal."
- **`files/`:** much of the same material is regrouped into about 20 thematic sections (WAR ARTISTS, NEO GEO, VIDEO INSTALLATION, WORKS ON PAPER…). It also adds about 530 sentences that aren't in the Tate version, and ends with Volker Eichmann.

## Why the timing differs

Every box has the same movement:
- an approach that grows from 0 to 1em while rising 50px;
- an exit that grows from 1em to 20em while moving 950px down (section headings go 1300px up instead).

Only the durations change. In the PHP generator (`generator/controls.php`), you set a start and finish speed in sentences per minute for each section. Each box's duration was then interpolated linearly across the boxes in that section. So the timing depends on how many boxes a section has, and the two versions differ in three ways:

1. **The same speed curve over fewer boxes.** Both start at about 55 seconds per exit and accelerate. The Tate version spreads the curve over 543 fewer boxes, so it moves through the boxes sooner. It reaches POSTMODERNISM at 7h18m, against 7h27m in `files/`.
2. **A slightly different final speed.** The last boxes take 0.3s in the Tate version and 0.25s in `files/`.
3. **Different section sizes.** Sections that were edited, like PERSPECTIVE (119 vs 128 boxes) or CUBISM (89 vs 97), get correspondingly shorter or longer.

## What this means for the redevelopment

Use the Tate SVGs as the source, with `final_exported.txt` to check the text against. Their per-box durations are the timings that were actually shown, so the extractor should copy them exactly rather than recalculate the acceleration.

**On the font:** if "pm" is your partner's own typeface, it would be worth asking them about publishing it as a web font. The conversion itself is easy, because every file embeds the same 237 glyphs.

Shall I start on the extractor and a `soa1` test clip using the Tate files?

## User - 2026-10-02 16:44 UTC

Yes please

## Claude

I'll check the repo state, the font definition, how the text is coloured, and whether ffmpeg is available.

> *Bash: Check repo, font-face, styling and ffmpeg*

No `<font-face>`, no fill and no background are declared. I'll check the generator's SVG header to see what the projection actually looked like.

> *Bash: Look for colours and font setup in generator*

> *Bash: Check fonts, fades, and create develop branch*

The `develop` branch is created. There are no fades in the Tate files, only the zoom behaviour, and Liberation Sans is installed for rendering. Writing the extractor now.

> *Write: StoryOfArt/redux/scripts/extract-timeline.js*

> *Bash: Run the extractor and inspect output*

> *Write: StoryOfArt/redux/player.js*

> *Write: StoryOfArt/redux/index.html*

Next, the capture script. It renders exact frames through `player.renderAt()` and pipes them to ffmpeg, so playback speed doesn't matter.

> *Write: StoryOfArt/redux/scripts/capture.js*

> *Bash: Create package.json and install puppeteer-core*

Before rendering video, I'll take stills of text at rest to check the line wrapping and justification.

> *Bash: Find sample boxes for stills*

> *Bash: Render stills at several moments*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/stills/still-9258.05.png*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/stills/still-5.png*

> *Bash: Fix last-line offset and re-render stills*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/stills/still-9258.05.png*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/stills/still-9265.png*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/stills/still-110.png*

> *Bash: Render opening and fast test clips*

Both clips rendered at about 20 frames a second. Next I'm pulling frames out of the videos to check the motion.

> *Bash: Make contact sheets from test clips*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/contact-opening.png*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/contact-fast.png*

> *Write: StoryOfArt/redux/README.md*

> *Bash: Show working tree status*

The Tate version now plays in a modern browser and renders to video. I've made two test clips for you to compare against how you remember the projection:

- [output/test-opening.mp4](../StoryOfArt/redux/output/test-opening.mp4): the first 30 seconds at 30fps.
- [output/test-fast.mp4](../StoryOfArt/redux/output/test-fast.mp4): 20 seconds from 9h25m at 50fps, where each box takes 0.6 seconds.

Everything is in a new `redux/` folder on a new `develop` branch in StoryOfArt, not yet committed.

**How it works**
- **Extractor:** [extract-timeline.js](../StoryOfArt/redux/scripts/extract-timeline.js) reads `soa1`–`soa8` in Tate order and writes `timeline.json` (1.2MB). It holds 5,812 boxes over 9h30m, with each box's text, size, line spacing, two durations and easing. There are no pauses or fades in the Tate files, and only two easing presets: one for body text and one for headings.
- **Player:** [player.js](../StoryOfArt/redux/player.js) is a port of `TextSpline` plus the SMIL motion, with the same `keySplines` easing. Only one text element ever exists, so memory stays flat over the 9.5 hours. [index.html](../StoryOfArt/redux/index.html) plays it in real time; `?t=2h15m` jumps to a point, `?debug` shows the time, and space pauses. It loops, as it did at the Tate.
- **Capture:** [capture.js](../StoryOfArt/redux/scripts/capture.js) renders exact frames in headless Chrome and pipes them to ffmpeg. It runs at about 20 frames a second, so the whole piece at 30fps is roughly 14 hours in one process. It's easy to split into time ranges and render in parallel. At these sizes the full piece should come to a few GB.

**Decisions to check**
- **The font is Arial.** "pm" has Arial's PANOSE number, metrics and glyph widths; it was presumably converted with Batik, which is in `generator/includes`. The player uses Arial, or Liberation Sans, which has the same metrics, so lines wrap identically. The clips were rendered in Liberation Sans, which has the same metrics but slightly different letter shapes.
- **Black text on white.** The original never set a colour or background, so I used the SVG defaults. If it was projected as white on black, that's a two-line change.
- **1em = 12px.** The layout code assumes this throughout (`size * 12`), so I set it explicitly. A browser's default of 16px would wrap every paragraph differently.
- **Last line of each paragraph.** `TextSpline` doubled the offset used to left-align the last line. In Chrome that pushes it about 180px too far left, so Adobe's viewer must have handled the offset differently. I used a single offset, which gives the intended justified block with a left-aligned last line. It's one constant, `StoryOfArt.lastLineShift`.
- **Aspect ratio.** The piece was composed at 1024×768 (4:3), but the README describes a 25' × 15' projection, which is 5:3. Do you remember whether it was stretched or masked?

**Not done yet**
- I haven't rendered the full piece.
- I haven't checked the player in Firefox or Safari.

Shall I commit this, and then set up a parallel full render?

## User - 2026-10-02 17:12 UTC

The projection was masked in the Tate - yes please commit. I'd rather the render was in sections - maybe even split at headings?

## Claude

I'll commit first.

> *Bash: Commit the redux folder on develop*

> *Bash: Count heading boxes and check machine resources*

That gives 71 headings plus a 90-second introduction before "THE STORY OF ART", so 72 sections. Next I'll add frame-range and aspect options to the capture script.

> *Bash: Add frame range and aspect options*

Now the section renderer itself.

> *Write: StoryOfArt/redux/scripts/render-sections.js*

> *Bash: List the sections and their durations*

> *Bash: Test-render two short sections at 5:3*

## User (sent while Claude was working) - 2026-10-02 17:14 UTC

Can they be rendered at 16:9?

## Claude

> *Bash: Check longest paragraph and test 16:9 render speed*

> *Bash: Render the longest paragraph at 16:9*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/stills169/still-32256.58.png*

> *Bash: Document section rendering and commit*

Yes, the sections can be rendered at 16:9, and the split-at-headings render is ready to run. 16:9 trims 96 units off the top and bottom of the 1024×768 composition, a little more than the Tate's 5:3 mask (77 units). Even the tallest paragraph in the piece, 10 lines about a British sculptor, sits well inside that band; the still is at `output/stills169/`. Both commits are on `develop`: `5c35fc2` (the player and capture) and `7046b94` (sections and aspect options).

The script is [render-sections.js](../StoryOfArt/redux/scripts/render-sections.js):
- **Sections:** there are 72, one per heading plus the 90-second introduction before "THE STORY OF ART". Files are named like `23-perspective.mp4`; `--list` shows them with start times and lengths.
- **Clean joins:** every section uses the same global frame grid, so when they're all done, `ffmpeg -f concat … -c copy` joins them without re-encoding and without dropped or doubled frames.
- **Stop and restart:** sections are written to a `.partial` file and renamed when finished, so a restart skips any that are done. `--only 23,71` re-renders individual sections.
- **Masking:** `--aspect` takes any ratio, and `?aspect=5:3` or `?aspect=16:9` works in the browser player too.

I test-rendered two short sections at 5:3 (the introduction and THE BRONZE AGE) and a 16:9 clip. Rendering the whole piece will take a while:
- At 1920×1080, each job renders about 16 frames a second, so the whole piece is about 17.5 job-hours.
- The longest section, PAINTING (the alphabetical run of artists, 1h35m), takes about 3 hours on its own. The renderer starts it first, but past 5 or 6 jobs extra jobs won't make it much quicker.
- With 5 jobs on your 12 cores, expect about 3.5 hours.

The command is:
```
cd redux && node scripts/render-sections.js --width 1920 --aspect 16:9 --jobs 5
```

That keeps your machine busy for a few hours, so I haven't started it. Do you want me to run it in the background now, or would you rather start it yourself?

---

## User - 2026-10-02 17:26 UTC

One quick question before you start - can you decompile swf files?

## Claude

Yes, with a tool. I can't read the SWF binary format directly, but these handle it:

- **[JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler (FFDec)](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)** is open source and has a command-line mode I can drive. It decompiles ActionScript 1/2/3 to readable source, and exports shapes and morph shapes as SVG, plus frames as PNG or SVG, images, sounds, text and fonts. It needs Java. For a timeline-animated piece, the SVG frame export is probably the most useful part.
- **[Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs)** is a Flash Player emulator written in Rust that runs SWFs in a modern browser or on the desktop. Coverage of ActionScript 1/2 and timeline animation is good; AS3 is less complete. It can also play a piece in headless Chrome for frame capture, the same way the Story of Art capture works.
- **swftools** (`swfdump`, `swfextract`) is older, but fine for a quick look at a file's structure and assets.

So for a Flash piece, like the Swift 3D / Flash work mentioned in the Story of Art README, there are two routes. You could keep it playable as it is via Ruffle, or extract it with FFDec to rebuild or render to video. I haven't checked whether Java or any of these tools are installed here; it's quick to set up if needed.

Which SWF did you have in mind? And should I start the Story of Art section render in the background now, at 16:9 1920×1080 with 5 jobs?

---

## User - 2026-10-02 17:28 UTC

OK - that's one for another day - run the render job for the whole thing and I'll check back before I go to bed!

## Claude

> *Bash: Render all 72 sections at 16:9 1920x1080*

> *Bash: Confirm the render started*

The full render is running in the background: 72 sections, about 1.03 million frames at 1920×1080 (16:9), with 5 jobs. All five have started, beginning with the longest sections (PAINTING, PERSPECTIVE, MEDIEVAL ART and so on).

It should take about 3.5 hours. PAINTING alone will need around 3 hours.

**Checking progress**
- `tail redux/output/render.log` prints a line as each section finishes.
- `ls redux/output/sections/*.mp4 | grep -vc partial` counts finished sections, out of 72.

**If it's interrupted** (sleep, reboot), rerun the same command: finished sections are skipped. Only the sections that were in progress start again, from the beginning.
```
cd redux && node scripts/render-sections.js --width 1920 --aspect 16:9 --jobs 5
```

**When it's done,** the log ends with the command to join everything into one file without re-encoding:
```
cd redux && ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i output/sections/concat.txt -c copy output/story-of-art.mp4
```

I'll be notified when the job finishes. If it does while this session is still open, I'll check for failed sections and tell you the result.

> *Bash: Check render results*

All 72 sections finished with no failures, 3.1GB in total. Next I'll check that the frame counts add up, then join them.

> *Bash: Verify frame totals and join sections*

The frame count matches exactly and the joined file is the right length. One last check: a few frames from across the joined file.

> *Bash: Grab frames from the joined video*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/check.png*

> *Bash: Remove temporary check frames*

The whole of The Story of Art is now one video, `redux/output/story-of-art.mp4`: 9h 30m 14s at 1920×1080 (16:9), 30fps, 3.3GB.

- **Render:** all 72 sections finished with no failures.
- **Frame count:** the sections add up to exactly 1,026,433 frames, matching the timeline.
- **Joined file:** it's the right length. I checked frames at 1h30m (Egyptian hieroglyphs), 7h55m (the PAINTING heading lifting off) and 9h30m (one of the last boxes), and they show the expected text in the right places.

The individual sections are kept in `redux/output/sections/`, e.g. `23-perspective.mp4`, so you can watch or re-render any of them separately. `sections.json` lists each section's start time in the full piece. The `output/` folder is gitignored, so none of the video is in the repo.

## User - 2026-10-03 09:13 UTC

They look really good. Is it possible to make images I can use as video placeholders for each section - maybe tasken from when the titles are centre screen?

## Claude

I'll add a `--posters` option to the section renderer. It will take one still per section at the moment the heading comes to rest in the centre, at the same size and crop as the video.

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/scripts/render-sections.js*

> *Bash: Add poster mode and render all 72 posters*

All 72 posters rendered in 5 seconds. I'll refresh `sections.json` to include them, then look at a sample.

> *Bash: Refresh section index and montage sample posters*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/posters-check.png*

> *Bash: Document posters and commit*

There's now a poster image for each of the 72 sections, in `redux/output/sections/` next to the videos. Each has the same name as its video (`23-perspective.mp4` → `23-perspective.png`), at the same 1920×1080 size and 16:9 crop.

- **Section headings:** each poster is taken at the moment the heading comes to rest in the centre, at the end of its zoom-in. PERSPECTIVE, for example, is the frame at 2:46:35.
- **Introduction:** it has no heading, so its poster uses the first sentence, "In the twenty first century it is thought to be difficult to define art."
- **Index:** `sections.json` now lists each section's poster file and the time it was taken from.

I've added a `--posters` option to `render-sections.js` and committed it (`5aaafaa`). It only takes about 5 seconds for all 72:
```
node scripts/render-sections.js --posters --width 1920 --aspect 16:9
```

The titles are true to the piece, which means they're small. At rest a heading is about 29px tall in a 1920px-wide frame, with a lot of white around it, so on a small thumbnail it may be hard to read. If you want something bolder, I could take the frame a moment later instead, as the heading starts to swell (at two or three times the size) on its way off the top of the screen. That's still a real frame from the piece.

---

## User - 2026-10-03 09:16 UTC

Yes that sounds good

## Claude

I'll work out, for each section, the moment its heading has grown to 3× its resting size on the way out. That means inverting the original easing curve; it's an option, so the size can be changed.

> *Bash: Render posters at 3x scale during zoom-out*

> *Bash: Montage sample posters*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/posters-check.png*

> *Bash: Compare heading box parameters*

> *Bash: Cap intro poster scale and re-render it*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/sections/00-introduction.png*

The introduction now fits. Next I'll update the README and commit.

> *Bash: Update README and commit poster change*

I've redone all 72 section posters with the bigger headings. Each one is now taken as the heading leaves the screen, at the moment it has grown to three times its resting size. They're in `redux/output/sections/` with the same names as before, and `sections.json` has the new times.

- **Headings:** at 1920×1080 a heading is now about 90px tall, so it should be readable as a thumbnail. Each sits slightly above centre because it's already moving up, and that position is the same in every poster.
- **Introduction:** its first sentence is much wider than a heading and was cut off at the edges at 3×, so I capped it at 2×. It now fits the frame.

The size is adjustable with `--poster-scale`. For example, `--poster-scale 4` makes the headings bigger, and `--poster-scale 1` goes back to the heading at rest in the centre. The change is committed as `84e380b`.

Having checked the browser version of StoryOfArt, the text animation is not as smooth as the original. I remember using fonts in the original caused the animation of letters to appear to step - in the redux version it's like there is no anti-aliasing around the letters and you could see the single pixel changges when size increases quite clearly. This was one of the reasons we switched to using SVG fonts - the letters scaled way more smoothly. In fact, using fonts in the original was so bad it would never have been acceptable  (the results were catastrophic in Adober's Viewer). Is there a way to make the font scale more smoothly?

## Claude

You're right, and it has the same cause as in 2004. The player animates font size, so the browser re-renders real text at every frame. Browsers hint glyphs to the pixel grid and round glyph positions and widths at each size, so as the text grows, letters and gaps jump a pixel at a time instead of scaling smoothly. The SVG font fixed this in the original because its glyphs were plain vector paths, which scale with no hinting at all.

The faithful fix is to go back to that. The original glyph outlines are still embedded in every Tate file: 237 glyphs of "pm" (Arial) as SVG paths. I can extract them, lay the text out from their advance widths (as Adobe's viewer did when it measured the SVG font), and draw each glyph as a path. Then I'll replace the font-size animation with an equivalent scale transform. That's exactly equivalent, because everything inside the box is measured in ems from one anchor point. It also removes the dependency on Arial or Liberation Sans being installed. First I'll check the font data: whether it has kerning, and whether it covers every character the text uses.

> *Bash: Inspect embedded font: kerning, coverage, consistency*

> *Bash: Extract the embedded font into the timeline*

The font is now in the timeline: 83 glyphs, which adds only 16KB. Next I'll rewrite the player to lay text out from the glyph widths and draw it as paths.

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/player.js*

> *Write: StoryOfArt/redux/player.js*

I left an unused variable in `layout()`, so I'll remove it. Then I'll update the page's CSS, which still styles `<text>` elements that no longer exist.

This is the same technique I used in another project where I dynamically replaced text elements with path elements so glyphs could scale better

I'd also like to include a full scereen control in the redux browser version

Adding the fullscreen button to the redux page now.

> *Bash: Add fullscreen button to the redux page and screenshot it*

> *Read: scratchpad/redux-fs.png*

The text renders correctly, and the button appears top right, but the icon looks blocky at this size. I'll zoom in on it.

> *Bash: Zoom in on the fullscreen button*

> *Read: scratchpad/fs-zoom.png*

The icon is right: the four corner brackets, the same as error404's. Last step: update the README's notes on fidelity and on the browser controls.

> *Bash: Update README and check for stale references*

The text now scales smoothly, using the same fix as in 2004: the letters are drawn as paths instead of browser text. The redux browser version also has the fullscreen control you asked for. Neither change is committed yet.

**The font fix**
- **Extractor:** it copies the glyphs from the original embedded "pm" font into `timeline.json`. Only the 83 characters the text uses are needed, which adds 16KB.
- **Player:** each letter is drawn as a vector path, and the text is laid out using the font's own letter widths, as Adobe's viewer did. The font-size animation becomes a scale around each box's anchor point. That's equivalent, because everything in a box is measured in ems from that point.
- **Measured:** I rendered the first sentence zooming in at 40 moments, 10ms apart.

  | Version | Frame steps where the text didn't change |
  |---|---|
  | Old (browser text) | 8 of 39, then it jumped to catch up |
  | New (glyph paths) | 0 of 39 |

  This was headless Chrome on Linux, which places text fairly precisely. On your browser, with stronger hinting, the old stepping was probably worse. Paths aren't hinted on any platform.
- **Layout:** line breaks and justification are identical to before. The letters now use the original outlines exactly, not Liberation Sans, and the player no longer depends on any font being installed.

**Fullscreen control:** a button at the top right with the same icon as error404's, and the F key toggles fullscreen too. Because it's a projection piece, the button and the mouse pointer appear when the mouse moves and fade out after 3 seconds. The button doesn't appear in video renders.

The README's notes on fidelity and on the browser controls are updated.

**The video is now out of date.** It was rendered with browser text, so it has the stepping. A full re-render takes about 3½ hours with 5 jobs, plus a few seconds for the posters. Shall I commit these changes and start the re-render?

## User - 2026-10-03 18:34 UTC

Yes please

## Claude

I'll commit just the redux changes. Your staged `sessions/` files stay staged.

> *Bash: Commit the redux changes and check disk space*

> *Bash: Re-render sections, posters and full video with glyph paths*

> *Bash: Confirm the re-render started*

The changes are committed as `700e302` on `develop`, and the full re-render is running in the background.

It's going into `output/sections-new/` alongside the current files, so nothing existing is overwritten while it runs. It renders all 72 sections at 1920×1080, then the posters, then joins them into `output/story-of-art-new.mp4`. The first five sections have started, longest first. It should take about 3½ hours, depending on how much slower drawing paths is than drawing text.

When it finishes, I'll check the frame count and some sample frames. If they're right, I'll swap the new video and sections in for the current ones. Progress is logged in `redux/output/render-new.log`.

> *Bash: Check the re-render results*

All 72 sections and posters rendered, and the joined video has exactly 1,026,433 frames, the same as before. Next I'll compare a few frames from the old and new videos.

> *Bash: Compare frames from old and new videos*

> *Read: StoryOfArt/redux/output/compare.png*

> *Bash: Count frozen frames during a zoom in both videos*

> *Bash: Swap in the new renders and keep the old ones aside*

The re-render with the original font's glyph paths is finished and swapped in.

- **`output/story-of-art.mp4`:** 9h 30m 14s at 1920×1080, 30fps, 3.9GB. It has exactly 1,026,433 frames, the same as before.
- **`output/sections/`:** all 72 section videos and their posters, re-rendered the same way. `concat.txt` and `sections.json` are there as before.

Old and new frames at 1:30 and 7:55 have the same text in the same places and sizes; the letters are now the original outlines, which you can see in the G of "PAINTING". I couldn't confirm the smoother scaling from the video files themselves, because the encoder means no two frames are ever byte-identical. The earlier test on rendered stills is the evidence for that: 8 frozen frames then a jump with browser text, none with glyph paths.

The previous renders are in `output/old-text-rendering/` (6.2GB), so you can compare them, especially the slow zooms near the start. Delete that folder when you're happy. The code was already committed as `700e302`, and `output/` isn't tracked, so there's nothing new to commit.

I'd like the GitHub Pages site for the StoryOfArt repo to consist of an index page which introduces the work, then links to the browser version. Under this I'd like the videos, all of which will be served from https://media.bjorsq.net/soa/ starting with the full version, followed by each of the sections. Information such as frame rates, number of frames,render times, number of text components, word count, starting and finishing speed (animation durations) and any other metrics should be included in an information box to the left (or above on mobile).

## Claude

I'll start by collecting the facts for the page from the render outputs, logs and machine: file sizes, render times, and the CPU and software versions used.

## User (sent while Claude was working) - 2026-10-04 10:35 UTC

Is it simple to include the screenshot function in the browser version like in error404?

## Claude

> *Bash: Find where to add the screenshot button*

> *Bash: Read the button styles and script*

The current styles target the fullscreen button directly, so I'll give both buttons a shared class and place the camera below.

> *Bash: Add the screenshot button to the redux player*

> *Bash: Test the redux screenshot button at two aspect ratios*

Both screenshots downloaded at the right sizes: 2048×1536 for 4:3 and 2048×1152 for 16:9. The 404s are just the missing favicon. Next I'll check what's in the image.

> *Bash: Put both screenshots side by side*

> *Read: scratchpad/soa-dl/both.png*

> *Bash: Document the screenshot button and rebuild the page*

The index page is built, and the browser version now has a screenshot button. None of it is committed yet.

**The index page**

The page is `index.html` at the repo root. It's generated by `redux/scripts/build-site.js` from the timeline and render outputs, so rerun `node redux/scripts/build-site.js` after any re-render.

- **Top:** title, a four-paragraph introduction to the work (written from the README's account), and a "Watch it in your browser" link to `redux/`, with a one-line note about the controls.
- **Videos:** the full piece first, then the 72 sections in a two-column grid. Each section caption gives its start time, length, boxes, words, speed per box, frames, file size and render time.
  - Videos and posters are loaded from `https://media.bjorsq.net/soa/` and nothing downloads until someone presses play.
  - The full version's poster is the THE STORY OF ART heading.
- **Information box:** on the left and sticky on desktop; above the videos on mobile. It has four groups:

  | Group | Includes |
  |---|---|
  | The piece | running time, 5,812 text boxes, 108,812 words, 11,326 lines, 534,549 letters drawn; half the words come in the last 17% of the running time |
  | Speed | first box 5s in and 5s out (6 a minute), slowest 5s in and 55s out, last 0.3s in and 0.3s out (100 a minute); the zoom and motion distances, easing, font and text sizes |
  | The original | Tate and Toronto, 25′ × 15′, Adobe SVG Viewer 3, 8 files totalling 8.3MB, the PHP/MySQL tool, the 2.8GHz Xeon |
  | The videos | 1920×1080 16:9 crop, 30fps, 1,026,433 frames, H.264 CRF 18, 3.89GB (909 kbit/s); rendered 3 October 2026 in 3h 58m with 5 jobs (19h 51m of job time, 72 frames a second); headless Chrome 154, ffmpeg 7.1.5, Ryzen 5 5500 |

- **Style:** black Arial on white, like the piece itself.

I previewed it at desktop and phone widths.

**For it to work:**
- **Upload these to `media.bjorsq.net/soa/`:** `story-of-art.mp4`, plus the 72 section `.mp4` files and their 72 `.png` posters, all from `redux/output/sections/`.
- **GitHub Pages:** I couldn't check the repo's Pages settings because the GitHub CLI isn't logged in here. I've assumed Pages publishes the repo root, and added an empty `.nojekyll` so GitHub serves the archive's files as they are. Pages will also need to be pointed at whichever branch you merge `develop` into.

**The screenshot button**

Yes, it was simple, simpler than error404: the projection is a single SVG with the letters already drawn as paths, so the browser can draw it straight onto a canvas with no library.

- It sits under the fullscreen button, with the same shutter sound and flash as error404, and both buttons hide with the mouse pointer when the mouse is still.
- It saves a PNG at twice the composition's resolution, named after the moment in the piece, e.g. `story-of-art-02h46m35s.png`. That's 2048×1536 at 4:3, or 2048×1152 with `?aspect=16:9`.
- I tested both sizes in headless Chrome, and they came out with the right content and crop.
- It's documented in the redux README, and the index page mentions it.

Shall I commit all of this?

Can the info go at the bottom of the page

## Claude

I'll move the information below the videos. With the full width available at the bottom, I'll lay its four groups out side by side (The piece, Speed, The original, The videos), stacking on narrower screens. The videos then get the page's full width.

> *Bash: Find the layout markup and styles*

> *Bash: Read the layout section of the page template*

> *Bash: Move the info box below the videos and preview*

> *Read: scratchpad/bottom-info-desk.png*

> *Read: scratchpad/bottom-top-desk.png*

The information now sits at the bottom, but at this width its groups wrap three plus one, which looks unbalanced. Two columns gives an even two-by-two grid, so I'll set that.

> *Bash: Use a two-by-two grid for the info and preview*

> *Read: scratchpad/bottom-info-desk.png*

Now an even two-by-two grid. Last step: rebuild with the real media URL, since the preview pointed at the local posters.

> *Bash: Rebuild the page with the media URL*

The information is now at the bottom of the page, after the section videos and just above the footer.

- **Layout:** its four groups sit in a two-by-two grid on desktop (The piece and Speed, then The original and The videos), and stack into one column on narrower screens.
- **Videos:** with the sidebar gone, they use the page's full width. The full piece is wider, and the sections now fit three to a row on a typical desktop instead of two.

I've rebuilt `index.html` with the `media.bjorsq.net/soa/` links, and the change is in `build-site.js` so future rebuilds keep it. Nothing is committed yet: the page, `.nojekyll`, `build-site.js`, and the screenshot button changes are all waiting. Shall I commit them?

## User - 2026-10-04 10:47 UTC

Yes please

## Claude

> *Bash: Commit the site and screenshot button*

It's committed as `ce20d52` on `develop`. The commit includes the index page, `.nojekyll`, `build-site.js` and the screenshot button changes. Your staged `sessions/` files are still staged and weren't included.

Before the site goes live:
1. **Upload the media to `media.bjorsq.net/soa/`:** `story-of-art.mp4` from `redux/output/`, plus the 72 section `.mp4` files and 72 `.png` posters from `redux/output/sections/`.
2. **Point Pages at the code:** merge `develop` into the branch GitHub Pages publishes from, and set Pages to publish that branch's root folder.
